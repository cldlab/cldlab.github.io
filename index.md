# Welcome to the Computation, Learning, & Development Lab!

<br>

We are housed in the [Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences](https://www.bu.edu/psych/) at Boston University.

Research in the lab focuses on understanding developmental changes in value-guided learning, memory, and exploration from childhood to early adulthood.

We aim to address questions like: Across development, how do we flexibly adapt our learning processes to the demands of varied contexts? How do we learn about the structure of the environment and then use that structural knowledge to guide subsequent learning and decision-making? How do we learn to learn over multiple timescales of experience?
