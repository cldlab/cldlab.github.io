description: "Ipek recently graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, where she studied Cognitive Science with a concentration in computation and cognition, and minored in Data Science and Computational Neuroscience. She is broadly interested in how we learn from our experiences, make decisions, and form judgments, as well as how these processes can be formalized through computational models of the mind. She is also deeply interested in the intersection of psychology and computer science and is concurrently pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Computer Science. When not in lab, she likes to kickbox, watch (very old) movies, explore the city, and travel to new ones."
