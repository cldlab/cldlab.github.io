description: "Ipek recently graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, where she studied Cognitive Science with a concentration in computation and cognition, and minored in Data Science and Computational Neuroscience. She is broadly interested in how we learn from our experiences, make decisions, and form judgments, as well as how these processes can be formalized through computational models of the mind. At the Computation, Learning, & Development Lab, she supports projects investigating how learning and decision-making evolve across development, with a particular focus on how children and adults infer what to learn, when to explore, and how to adapt in changing environments."
