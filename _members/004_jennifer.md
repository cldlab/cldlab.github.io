description: "Jennifer is an undergraduate student in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at Boston University, where she is pursuing a B.A. in Psychology with a minor in Advertising. Her academic interests lie at the intersection of cognitive psychology, user experience, and applied behavioral research. Before joining BU’s research community, Jennifer worked on market and consumer behavior projects at Ipsos and BrainCo, where she explored how data and neuroscience can inform more human-centered technologies. When not in the lab or class, Jennifer enjoys drawing,  gossiping, and binge-watching long-haul TV shows while having ice-cream."
