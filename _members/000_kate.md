description: "Kate is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at Boston University. She is interested in understanding how learning, memory, and decision-making systems change and shape adaptive behavior across development.

Kate received an Sc.B. in Cognitive Neuroscience from Brown University, an MSc in Experimental Psychology from the University of Oxford, and a Ph.D. in Psychology from NYU. She completed postdoctoral training at the Princeton Neuroscience Institute before returning to her home state of MA to launch the lab in 2025.  

When not doing research, she enjoys traveling, trying new restaurants, and watching TV, though these days her hobbies have been supplanted by tending to a [demanding new roommate](/static/img/members/riley.jpeg)."
