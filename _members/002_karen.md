description: "Karen is a Ph.D. student in the Brain, Behavior, and Cognition program. She is interested in understanding the computational mechanisms of mood dynamics, and how they can guide adaptive learning and decision-making across development. Karen received her BA in Psychological and Behavioral Sciences from University of Cambridge and an MRes from UCL, where she also completed a research placement at Yale University. Outside of research, she is usually trying to train her cat to do tricks, cooking, or climbing!"
