# Join the lab!
----

<br> 

### BU undergraduates and MA students
The lab has opportunities for BU undergraduates (and potentially for MA students) beginning in September 2025. If you are a current student at BU interested in joining the lab, please fill out our [interest form](https://forms.gle/C8bUBZkPjhorWb3P9). Once you fill out the form, you can expect to hear from us within a few weeks. 

In general, we will have many open lab meetings throughout the semester, which you can attend as a low-commitment way to learn about our work. If you would like to work as a research assistant, then we ask that you commit at least 10 hours per week for at least two semesters (fall, spring, summer). There are potential opportunities for BU students to join the lab as volunteers, paid RAs (if eligible for work-study), and directed study or [UROP](https://www.bu.edu/urop/) students.

Unfortunately, the lab is unlikely to have openings for non-BU students during the 2025 - 2026 academic year.

### Postdoctoral researchers
The lab is not actively recruiting postdocs at this time. However, if you have shared research interests and would like to discuss a potential position, please email [Kate](mailto:katenuss@gmail.com) to discuss opportunities.

### Ph.D. students
I will be reviewing Ph.D. applications this cycle (for students hoping to start in September 2026). I will at most be admitting one student to the lab, and am looking for applicants whose research interests align closely with the lab's past and planned work. 

Prospective students can apply to join the lab through the ['Brain, Behavior, and Cognition'](https://www.bu.edu/psych/academics/phd/bbc/) program or the ['Developmental Science'](https://www.bu.edu/psych/academics/phd/devscience/) program in the Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences. It is also possible for students to join the lab through the University-wide ['Graduate Program in Neuroscience'](https://www.bu.edu/neuro/academics/graduate/), though this program begins with a year of rotations. You can find more information about applying [here](https://www.bu.edu/cas/admissions/phd-mfa/apply/) and information about application fee waivers [here](https://www.bu.edu/cas/admissions/phd-mfa/apply/fee-waiver/).

Competitive applicants to the lab will have:
* experience working in a psychology or neuroscience research lab.
* intrinsic motivation, ambition, creativity, and persistence in tackling difficult intellectual challenges.
* a strong interest in developmental cognitive neuroscience / developmental computational cognitive science, with particular excitement for the labâ€™s core questions about the development of adaptive learning, memory, and exploration processes (see [research](/research) and [publications](/publications)).

In general, research in the lab is both developmental and computational. Because of this, students will be expected to have an interest in some aspect of development and a desire to learn computational methods (e.g., developing and fitting cognitive models; analyzing neuroimaging data). However, the Ph.D. is an opportune time for learning. You do not need to have any specific quantitative skills and you do not need to have experience conducting developmental research to be a competitive applicant to the lab. 

*Please note: The lab is NOT a good fit for students whose primary interests are clinical.*
