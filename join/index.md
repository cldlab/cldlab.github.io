### Postdoctoral researchers
If you have shared research interests and would like to discuss a potential position (beginning no earlier than fall 2025), please email me. I am happy to discuss opportunities!

### Ph.D. students
I will be reviewing Ph.D. applications in the upcoming cycle (deadline for psychology: December 1, 2024) for students interested in starting in September 2025. 

Prospective students can apply to join the lab through the ['Brain, Behavior, and Cognition'](https://www.bu.edu/psych/academics/phd/bbc/) program in the Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences. It may also be possible for students to join the lab through the University-wide ['Graduate Program in Neuroscience'](https://www.bu.edu/neuro/academics/graduate/), though this program begins with a year of rotations. Students are allowed to apply to both programs, but doing so requires paying the application fee twice. For those who are primarily interested in my lab, I recommend applying through the BBC program in the psychology department, and emailing me after you apply to ensure I read your application. You can find more information about applying [here](https://www.bu.edu/cas/admissions/phd-mfa/apply/) and information about application fee waivers [here.](https://www.bu.edu/cas/admissions/phd-mfa/apply/fee-waiver/).

I expect that entering Ph.D. students will begin their program with strong enthusiasm about conducting developmental studies and working together to build an innovative research agenda for ~5 years. Competitive applicants will likely have:
* experience working in a psychology or neuroscience research lab.
* intrinsic motivation, ambition, creativity, and persistence in tackling difficult intellectual challenges.
* a strong interest in developmental cognitive neuroscience / developmental computational cognitive science, with particular excitement about the lab’s core questions about the development of adaptive learning, memory, and exploration processes (see above, as well as [publications](/publications)).

In general, research in the lab will be both developmental and computational. Because of this, students will be expected to have an interest in some aspect of development and a commitment to learning computational methods (e.g., developing and fitting cognitive models; analyzing neuroimaging data). However, I view the Ph.D. as the opportune time for learning. You do not need to have any specific quantitative skills, and you do not need to have experience conducting developmental research to be a competitive applicant to the lab. 

Please [reach out](mailto:katenuss@gmail.com) if this sounds like you!  I am happy to answer any questions you have. 

*Please note: I cannot accept students through the clinical program. The lab is NOT a good fit for students whose primary interests are clinical.*

### Lab manager 
I will be hiring a full-time lab manager to start alongside me, in July 2025. The lab manager will be heavily involved in all phases of the research process while also helping to administer the day-to-day functioning of the lab. This position is ideal for a recent college graduate hoping to gain more research experience prior to pursuing a Ph.D. 

Responsibilities will include:
* helping to establish a fun, inclusive, and productive research environment. 
* administering the day-to-day functioning of the lab, which will involve spearheading participant recruitment, managing IRB protocols, and training new lab members.
* designing and conducting online, eye-tracking, and fMRI experiments with human participants, including children and adolescents.
* analyzing data and preparing findings for presentation and publication.

Desired qualifications include:
* a bachelor’s degree in psychology, neuroscience, computer science, or a related field.
* strong organizational and time management skills.
* experience conducting research in a psychology or neuroscience lab.
* an interest in the development of learning, memory, and decision-making
* knowledge of at least one programming language (e.g., R, python, julia, Matlab), or a commitment to learning to code.
* an interest in quantitative methodologies, including computational cognitive modeling and neuroimaging analyses (note: experience with these methods is not expected).

I will likely have an official job ad posted in January or February 2025, but if you are interested, please reach out with your CV and a description of your research interests.

### Undergraduates
I look forward to working with BU undergraduates beginning in September 2025. If you are a current student at BU interested in joining the lab, feel free to reach out to stay up-to-date about research opportunities. I do not anticipate having openings for non-BU undergraduates during the 2025 - 2026 academic year.
