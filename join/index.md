# Join the lab!

<br> 

### BU Undergraduates and MA students
The lab has opportunities for BU undergraduates (and potentially for MA students) beginning in September 2025. If you are a current student at BU interested in joining the lab, feel free to [reach out](mailto:bucoldlab@gmail.com) to stay up-to-date about research opportunities. Unfortunately, the lab is unlikely to have openings for non-BU undergraduates during the 2025 - 2026 academic year.

### Postdoctoral researchers
The lab is not actively recruiting postdocs at this time. However, if you have shared research interests and would like to discuss a potential position, please email [Kate](mailto:katenuss@gmail.com) to discuss opportunities.

### Ph.D. students
*The admissions cycle for students planning to begin their Ph.D. in September 2025 has now concluded. Kate may review applications in the next cycle (to begin fall 2026.) Please check this page for updates.* 

Prospective students can apply to join the lab through the ['Brain, Behavior, and Cognition'](https://www.bu.edu/psych/academics/phd/bbc/) program in the Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences. It is also possible for students to join the lab through the University-wide ['Graduate Program in Neuroscience'](https://www.bu.edu/neuro/academics/graduate/), though this program begins with a year of rotations. You can find more information about applying [here](https://www.bu.edu/cas/admissions/phd-mfa/apply/) and information about application fee waivers [here](https://www.bu.edu/cas/admissions/phd-mfa/apply/fee-waiver/).

Competitive applicants to the lab will have:
* experience working in a psychology or neuroscience research lab.
* intrinsic motivation, ambition, creativity, and persistence in tackling difficult intellectual challenges.
* a strong interest in developmental cognitive neuroscience / developmental computational cognitive science, with particular excitement about the labâ€™s core questions about the development of adaptive learning, memory, and exploration processes (see [research](/research) and [publications](/publications)).

In general, research in the lab will be both developmental and computational. Because of this, students will be expected to have an interest in some aspect of development and a desire to learn computational methods (e.g., developing and fitting cognitive models; analyzing neuroimaging data). However, the Ph.D. is an opportune time for learning. You do not need to have any specific quantitative skills and you do not need to have experience conducting developmental research to be a competitive applicant to the lab. 

*Please note: The lab is NOT a good fit for students whose primary interests are clinical.*
